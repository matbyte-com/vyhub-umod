The plugin connects your [VyHub](https://vyhub.net) store to your Rust server. It checks if a player has made a purchase on your VyHub store and delivers the order such as items, skins or ranks by typing commands in the server console. It also synchronizes player roles, warnings, and bans.

Registration is free; we only charge a commission of 3-5% on shop revenue.

The full documentation can be found [here](https://docs.vyhub.net).
